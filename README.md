# sitl

The script accepts information from the drone through a UDP socket,
While you have the sim running it will be constantly be sending UDP packets to that socket,
So to run the script just make sure the sim is running at the same time so that you receive information,
Since it receives data through a UDP connection you can place this repository anywhere on your device
